## Drees, Willem B., ed. “The Humanities.” In *What Are the Humanities For?*, 9–25. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2021.

The issue that the author wanted to address within the reading was about how complex it is to fully define the subject of Humanities whilst including its broad area of study, as well as figuring out why Humanities is important for us to study. Throughout the passage, Drees continuously provides the audience multiple definitions of what Humanities is, and what it aims to study. Not only that, he also seeks to provide multiple examples and ideas to articulate how humans act as a main role in Humanities. In the reading, I noticed multiple points that caught my attention, and thought were consequential in understanding how Drees views Humanities. First idea was the way how he defined Humanities at the beginning of the reading. Throughout the passage, Drees provides multiple definitions of what Humanities is. However, one of the most important definition that I personally picked was: 

  >   “Humanities are academic disciplines in which humans seek understanding of human self-understanding and self-expressions, and of the ways in which people thereby construct and experience the world they live in” (Drees 12).

The quote broadly implicated that humans are continuously studying each other in order to understand the way how we express ourselves. They way how he “present[ed] the humanities as a second-order activity” was also interesting (Drees 12). Humans are not just affecting the world, but they are also affected. We actively engage and create culture, cumulating experience. Next, it was also interesting how Drees brought the idea of another author’s idea of comparing humans as agents and as actors, further articulating that humans are affected by certain actions, but they also are the ones enacting some actions, causing effects to rise. Finally, Drees’s attempt to answer the question of Who Needs the Humanities was interesting. Drifting away, the question Drees posed made me wonder why studying Humanities would be important at all, and who is it really important to. Simply speaking, humans wo> uld need to study humanities in order understand the nature of humans better. The slight irony of having to study ourselves in order to understand ourselves better was very much interesting. Two questions I could think of from this reading was: 

      1.	To you, what does Humanities entail in whole?
      2.	Do you think it is necessary for non-Humanities major to learn about Humanities – especially those in engineering or other unrelated field of interest?
